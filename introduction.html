<h2>What is Air Pollution?</h2>
<p>Air pollution refers to the presence of harmful substances in the Earth's atmosphere, including gases, particulates, and biological molecules. This pollution can stem from both natural and human-made sources.</p>

<h3>Common Pollutants:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Particulate Matter (PM2.5 & PM10):</strong> Small particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.</li>
    <li><strong>Ozone (O3):</strong> At ground level, ozone is a harmful pollutant that affects human health and vegetation.</li>
    <li><strong>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2):</strong> Produced from vehicle exhaust and industrial processes, it contributes to the formation of smog and acid rain.</li>
    <li><strong>Carbon Monoxide (CO):</strong> A colorless, odorless gas from burning fossil fuels, CO reduces oxygen delivery to the body's organs and tissues.</li>
    <li><strong>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2):</strong> Emitted from fossil fuel combustion at power plants and industrial facilities, SO2 contributes to acid rain.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is one of the leading environmental health risks globally, responsible for millions of premature deaths each year. Efforts to reduce air pollution are essential to improving the health and quality of life for populations around the world.</p>
