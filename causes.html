<h2>Causes of Air Pollution</h2>
<p>Air pollution is caused by a combination of natural and anthropogenic (human-made) factors. In rural areas, some of the major causes of air pollution include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Burning of Fossil Fuels:</strong> Fossil fuel combustion from vehicles, power plants, and industries is the largest source of air pollution, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM).</li>
    <li><strong>Vehicular Emissions:</strong> The growing number of vehicles in rural and urban areas is a significant source of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). Poor maintenance and use of outdated vehicles exacerbate this problem.</li>
    <li><strong>Agricultural Practices:</strong> The use of pesticides, fertilizers, and burning of crop residues releases harmful chemicals like ammonia (NH3) into the air, contributing to air pollution in agricultural communities.</li>
    <li><strong>Industrial Emissions:</strong> Factories and industrial plants, particularly those located near rural communities, release a variety of harmful pollutants, including heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</li>
    <li><strong>Indoor Air Pollution:</strong> In many rural areas, households still use solid fuels like wood and coal for cooking and heating, releasing smoke and soot that contribute to poor indoor air quality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Industrial growth and urbanization are spreading into rural areas, bringing with them the negative impacts of air pollution. Combined with traditional practices like crop burning, these factors are deteriorating the air quality in villages, increasing the risk of health problems.</p>
