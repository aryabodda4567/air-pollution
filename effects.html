<h2>Effects of Air Pollution</h2>
<p>Air pollution affects both human health and the environment. Its effects can be classified into short-term and long-term impacts.</p>

<h3>Short-term Effects:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Respiratory Infections:</strong> Exposure to polluted air increases the risk of respiratory infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia.</li>
    <li><strong>Eye and Skin Irritations:</strong> Pollutants like ozone can cause burning eyes and skin irritations.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced Lung Function:</strong> High levels of air pollution reduce lung capacity, making breathing more difficult, especially for vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-term Effects:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chronic Respiratory Diseases:</strong> Prolonged exposure to pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5) increases the risk of developing chronic bronchitis, asthma, and other lung diseases.</li>
    <li><strong>Cardiovascular Diseases:</strong> Air pollution is linked to increased rates of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Premature Deaths:</strong> The WHO estimates that air pollution causes around 7 million premature deaths globally each year, particularly from heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Environmental Effects:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Global Warming:</strong> Pollutants such as CO2 and methane (CH4) contribute to the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change.</li>
    <li><strong>Ozone Depletion:</strong> Chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) damage the ozone layer, increasing the risk of skin cancer and other health issues due to higher ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure.</li>
    <li><strong>Acid Rain:</strong> Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) can lead to acid rain, which harms ecosystems, contaminates water bodies, and damages crops and infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
