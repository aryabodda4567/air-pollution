<h2>Solutions to Reduce Air Pollution</h2>
<p>Air pollution can be reduced through a combination of policy changes, technological innovations, and public awareness efforts. Below are some practical solutions that can help mitigate air pollution:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Switch to Renewable Energy:</b> Encouraging the use of solar, wind, and hydropower instead of fossil fuels can significantly reduce emissions.</li>
    <li><b>Adopt Electric Vehicles (EVs):</b> Promoting electric cars and public transportation can reduce vehicular emissions. Incentives for EV adoption could accelerate this shift.</li>
    <li><b>Better Waste Management:</b> Managing waste properly, especially in rural areas, by promoting recycling and discouraging open burning of waste can help curb the release of harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li><b>Agricultural Reforms:</b> Encouraging farmers to adopt sustainable practices, such as using organic fertilizers and avoiding crop residue burning, can reduce the release of pollutants into the atmosphere.</li>
    <li><b>Afforestation:</b> Planting more trees can absorb CO2, reduce the greenhouse effect, and improve air quality, particularly in heavily polluted areas.</li>
</ul>
