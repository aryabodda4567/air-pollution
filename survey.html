<h2>Survey Findings</h2>
<p>As part of the survey conducted in Swayambupuram village, we gathered data from local residents on the impact of air pollution on their health and environment. Here are the key findings:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Health Impacts:</strong> 70% of respondents reported suffering from respiratory issues such as asthma, coughing, and shortness of breath. Many attributed these issues to pollution from a nearby cement factory.</li>
    <li><strong>Agricultural Impact:</strong> Farmers noted that their crops were being damaged due to acid rain and soil contamination, which they believe are caused by pollution in the air and water.</li>
    <li><strong>Water Contamination:</strong> Several villagers reported that the local water sources had been contaminated, further harming crops and livestock and posing a risk to human health.</li>
    <li><strong>Indoor Air Pollution:</strong> 60% of households still rely on traditional wood-burning stoves for cooking, contributing to indoor air pollution, which is particularly harmful to women and children.</li>
</ul>

<p>These findings highlight the urgent need for better regulation of industrial emissions and for introducing cleaner cooking and heating alternatives to reduce indoor air pollution in rural households.</p>
